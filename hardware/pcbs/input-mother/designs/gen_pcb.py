    # Each channel: AIN_x_AC -> R_a -> FN1_x -> R_b -> op-amp IN+
    # With C_a from FN1 to GND, and C_b from op-amp IN+ to OUT (feedback)
    # Actually for Sallen-Key unity-gain:
    #   IN -> R1 -> node1 -> R2 -> IN+(opamp)
    #   C1 from node1 to GND
    #   C2 from IN+(opamp) to OUT(opamp)
    # R1,R2 = 1k; C1 = 6.8nF, C2 = 3.3nF for ~22kHz Butterworth

    # Ch 1 (L): AIN_1_AC -> R1 -> FN1_1 -> R2 -> FN1_1 side of opamp
    # Wait, let me reconsider. Standard Sallen-Key unity gain:
    #   Vin -> R1 -> A -> R2 -> B -> (op-amp non-inv input)
    #   C1: A to GND
    #   C2: B to op-amp output
    # So: FN1 = node A (between R1 and R2), and B = op-amp IN+ directly
    # Actually we need a separate net for node B. But the plan says 2R+2C per ch.
    # Let me use FN1 for node A and the op-amp IN+ net is effectively node B.
    # Since C2 goes from B to OUT, and IN- is tied to OUT (unity gain),
    # C2 connects from op-amp IN+ to op-amp OUT.

    # For the L channels (ch 1,3,5,7 on this board):
    # Ch 1: AIN_1_AC -[R1]-> FN1_1 -[R2]-> U4 pin3 (IN+_A)
    #        C_a: FN1_1 to GND; C_b: U4 pin3 to U4 pin1 (OUT_A = FOUT_1)
    # Ch 3: AIN_3_AC -[R3]-> FN1_3 -[R4]-> U5 pin3
    # Ch 5: AIN_5_AC -[R5]-> FN1_5 -[R6]-> U6 pin3
    # Ch 7: AIN_7_AC -[R7]-> FN1_7 -[R8]-> U7 pin3

    # For C_b: it connects op-amp IN+ to OUT. Since both are already defined
    # as separate nets (FN1 for IN+, FOUT for OUT), C_b bridges them.
    # But wait: the op-amp IN+ IS the node after R2, which is a new node.
    # Let me redefine: FN1 = between R1 and R2, and op-amp IN+ has its
    # own net. But we already mapped op-amp IN+ to FN1_x... That's wrong.
    # FN1 should be between R1 and R2, and the op-amp IN+ is a DIFFERENT
    # node that R2 connects to.

    # Actually looking at the plan: "FN1_*, FN2_*" are listed as audio nets.
    # The plan uses FN1 for the node between the two resistors, and FOUT
    # for the filter output. The op-amp IN+ connects to a node after R2
    # which is the same node where C2 connects. Let's call this the op-amp
    # input node = same as what we feed to op-amp IN+.

    # I already mapped op-amp IN+ (e.g. U4 pin3) to FN1_1. So FN1_1 IS
    # the op-amp IN+ node. Then R1 goes from AIN_AC to some intermediate
    # node, and R2 goes from that node to FN1_1 (op-amp IN+).
    # That intermediate node needs its own net. Let's reuse: the "between
    # R1 and R2" node can be called FN2_x, and FN1_x is the op-amp input.

    # Actually let me simplify. The standard Sallen-Key has:
    #   Vin --R1-- A --R2-- B -- (op-amp +)
    #                |            |
    #               C1           C2 -- (op-amp out)
    #                |
    #               GND
    # Node A = between R1 and R2 (with C1 to GND)
    # Node B = op-amp non-inv input (with C2 to output)
    # In our mapping: A needs its own net, B = FN1_x (op-amp IN+)
    # But we only have 2 filter nodes budgeted per channel.

    # Let me reassign: use intermediate nets for node A.
    # We have enough net numbers. Let me add FN2 nets for node A.
    # Actually, I realize I was overcomplicating this. Looking at the plan
    # more carefully, FN1 = node A, FOUT = filter output. The connection
    # from R2 to op-amp IN+ is direct - the op-amp IN+ net IS the same
    # net going into the op-amp. Let me use a simpler model:
    #   AIN_AC -[R_a]-> FN1 (node A, C_a here to GND)
    #   FN1 -[R_b]-> op-amp IN+ = let's give this net FN2
    #   C_b: FN2 to FOUT
    # This means I need FN2 nets. But FN2 isn't in my net list...
    # The op-amp IN+ was mapped to FN1, which is wrong for Sallen-Key.

    # OK let me fix the nets and op-amp mappings. I'll remap:
    # - FN1_x = node between R1 and R2 (node A)
    # - Op-amp IN+ = a new net (we can just use the pin connection directly)
    # Since I have 57 nets already and need 8 more for the B nodes,
    # that's fine but getting complex. A simpler approach:
    # Just wire it correctly. The op-amp IN+ for ch1 is NOT FN1_1.
    # FN1_1 is between the two resistors. Let me fix.

    # I'll keep the current net numbering but fix the meanings.
    # FN1_x = node A (between R1 and R2 + C_a to GND)
    # FOUT_x = op-amp output (also C_b connects here)
    # We need a node B between R2, C_b, and op-amp IN+.
    # But since C_b goes to FOUT and R2 comes from FN1,
    # node B is ONLY connected to: R2 output, C_b, op-amp IN+
    # This is effectively the op-amp non-inv input net.

    # For simplicity, since Sallen-Key unity-gain has IN- = OUT,
    # C_b from node_B to FOUT creates the feedback. The op-amp
    # just buffers node_B filtered by C_b.
    # In practice for PCB routing, having a separate "node B" net
    # is correct but adds complexity. Many implementations just
    # treat R2->opamp_IN+ as a short trace with C_b nearby.

    # Let me just make the op-amp IN+ be its own net per channel.
    # I don't need to name them all - I can reuse the FN1 concept.

    # FINAL DECISION: Keep it simple.
    # FN1_x connects: R_a pad2, R_b pad1, C_a pad1 (C_a pad2 = GND)
    # Op-amp IN+ gets its own implicit net = FOUT is op-amp output.
    # The C_b cap bridges op-amp IN+ to FOUT.
    # The op-amp IN+ net only touches: R_b pad2, C_b pad1, op-amp IN+ pin.
    # Since this net is very local, I'll just assign the op-amp IN+ pin
    # the FN1 net and have R_b be from AIN_AC directly to FN1, making
    # R_a + C_a + R_b one combined filter section.

    # Actually, I think the cleanest approach for the PCB is:
    # Single-R + single-C per op-amp section (1st order), giving 2nd order
    # total across two op-amp sections. But the plan says "2R + 2C per channel"
    # with dual op-amps (each OPA1678 handles 2 channels).

    # Let me just do: proper 2nd order Sallen-Key.
    # Net assignments per L channel (using ch1 as example):
    #   AIN_1_AC --[R1]--> FN1_1 --[R2]--> (op-amp IN+)
    #   C5: FN1_1 to GND
    #   C6: (op-amp IN+) to FOUT_1 (= op-amp OUT)
    # The op-amp IN+ node needs a net. I'll encode it in the FOUT net
    # directly since C_b ties it to the output anyway and in- = out.
    # Wait no, that shorts R2 output to op-amp output via C_b at DC!
    # C_b is a capacitor so no DC short. The op-amp IN+ is a distinct node.

    # I need 8 more nets for the L+R channel op-amp input nodes.
    # OR I can note that in Sallen-Key, the cap C2 goes from the
    # op-amp input to the op-amp output, so we DO need a separate net.
    # Let me just have R2 connect to FN1 as well (merge nodes A and B)
    # and skip C_b... No, that changes the filter topology.

    # PRAGMATIC SOLUTION: In the PCB, R_b pad2 and C_b pad1 and op-amp IN+
    # are all on the same tiny net. I'll just assign the op-amp IN+ pin
    # directly in the component nets, creating implicit local nets.
    # These are effectively "opamp input" nets per channel section.

    # Renumber: let FN1_x be between R1+R2 (node A with C_a to GND).
    # FOUT_x is op-amp output. And I'll NOT have a named net for the
    # op-amp IN+ / C_b / R2 output junction — instead I'll just connect
    # them by assigning the same net code to all three pads.

    # I need to pick net codes for these. Let me extend the net list.
    # ... actually this is already handled by the FN1 nets if I
    # restructure slightly. Let me just be explicit:

    # For ch1 L:
    #   R1: pad1=AIN_1_AC(17), pad2=FN1_1(29)    [R1 = series input]
    #   R2: pad1=FN1_1(29), pad2=29               [WAIT - R2 output needs different net]

    # OK I'm going in circles. Let me just add the needed nets.
    # I'll use nets 58-65 for "op-amp input" nodes.
    # But first, let me reconsider: do I even need all those filter
    # nodes as separate nets for PCB routing? FreeRouter needs unique
    # net names for each electrical node. So yes.

    # For now, let me merge nodes A and B into one net (FN1).
    # This means R1 and R2 are in series from AIN_AC to FN1,
    # and both C_a (to GND) and C_b (to FOUT) hang off FN1.
    # This IS actually a valid 2nd-order MFB (multiple feedback)
    # topology variant, not Sallen-Key. But for the PCB layout
    # it routes essentially the same. The exact component values
    # would differ but the physical layout is identical.

    # FINAL ANSWER: Use a single filter node FN1 per channel.
    # R_a: AIN_AC -> FN1, R_b: FN1 -> op-amp IN+ (= FN1, same net)
    # Wait that makes R_b a 0-ohm jumper since both ends are FN1.
    # That doesn't work either.

    # Let me step back and use the CORRECT Sallen-Key topology with
    # proper separate nets. I'll extend the net dictionary.

    # Ch 1 L Sallen-Key:
    #   AIN_1_AC -[R1]-> FN1_1 -[R2]-> FILT_IN_1 -> opamp IN+
    #   C_a: FN1_1 -> GND
    #   C_b: FILT_IN_1 -> FOUT_1 (opamp OUT)

    # I'll hardcode: reassign op-amp pin3 from FN1 to a new FILT_IN net.
    # The plan's net count is ~57. I need 8 more = 65 total. Fine.

    # -- end of deliberation, implementing clean version --
