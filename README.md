# MIXTEE

**Open-source 16-input / 8-output digital mixer with MIDI control and 16-track recording.**

Built around the Teensy 4.1, MIXTEE is a compact desktop mixer designed for electronic musicians, synth enthusiasts, and DIY audio builders. It handles mixing, monitoring, MIDI control, multitrack recording to SD card, and 16-in/8-out AES67 network audio — all in a 260 × 100 × 50 mm enclosure.

## Features

- **16 mono inputs** (8 stereo pairs) with per-channel gain, pan, mute, solo
- **8 outputs** (master stereo + 3 aux/FX sends)
- **16-track recording** direct to SD card (48 kHz / 24-bit WAV, 8 MB PSRAM buffer)
- **DAW connectivity** (16-in / 8-out via AES67 over Ethernet)
- **MIDI control** via 2× USB host ports + TRS MIDI in/out
- **4.3" TFT display** with 3 dedicated encoders (NavX, NavY, Edit) and 16 illuminated CHOC keys
- **Compact form factor** — 260 × 100 × 50 mm, all controls on top, all audio on back

## Architecture

MIXTEE uses four AK4619VN codecs on two TDM buses, driven by the Teensy 4.1's Cortex-M7 at 600 MHz. The analog front-end features OPA1678 op-amps with Sallen-Key anti-alias and reconstruction filters. Power is supplied via USB-C (5V/5A USB PD, fallback 5V/3A). DAW connectivity uses AES67 network audio over Ethernet (100 Mbps, DP83825I PHY on Teensy).
