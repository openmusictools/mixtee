# MIXTEE: System Topology

*← Back to [README](../README.md) | See also: [Hardware](hardware.md) · [Enclosure](enclosure.md)*

------

## Overview

MIXTEE uses a modular multi-board design with **galvanic isolation** between the digital and analog domains. The main board sits horizontally under the top panel and contains the isolation boundary (Si8662BB, ISO1541, MEJ2S0505SC). Six back-panel boards (three mother+daughter pairs) carry all audio I/O in the isolated analog domain. A dedicated IO board on the left side of the top panel handles Ethernet, USB MIDI host, and MIDI IN/OUT. A standalone HP Board carries the headphone amp in the isolated analog domain (powered from Board 1-top). A Keys4x4 PCB handles the illuminated switch grid. An off-the-shelf STUSB4500 breakout module on the back panel provides USB PD power input.

Total: **7 unique PCB designs**, 11 physical boards + 1 off-the-shelf power module.

For detailed per-board documentation, see each board's directory under `hardware/pcbs/`.

## Back Panel Board Arrangement

Looking at the back panel (260 mm wide × 50 mm tall):

The PWR USB-C receptacle mounts on the **Power Board** — a small dedicated PCB on the far right of the back panel. Labeled "PWR" (power only, 5V/5A PD). A 2-pin cable carries 5V + GND from the Power Board to the Main Board. An **off-the-shelf screw-collar momentary push button** ("POWER") mounts next to the PWR USB-C on the back panel, wired to the Main Board soft-latch circuit. DAW connectivity is via Ethernet (RJ45 on IO Board, top panel). The three mother+daughter pairs tile across the remaining back panel width.

## Design Reuse Opportunities

1. **Input mother boards (1-top, 2-top):** Same PCB. Codec I2C addresses set by solder jumpers. Output analog section + MCP23008 + TS5A3159 on Board 1-top populated; on Board 2-top left empty.
2. **All daughter/output boards (1-bot, 2-bot, O-top, O-bot):** Potentially same PCB if connector placement and jack spacing match. All are 4× TS jacks + ESD + one connector. Worth investigating during schematic phase — could reduce unique designs from 7 to 5 (Main, IO, HP, Input Mother, Universal Daughter, Keys4x4).
3. **Keys4x4 PCB**, **IO Board**, and **HP Board** are standalone custom designs with no reuse opportunities. The **Power Module** is an off-the-shelf STUSB4500 breakout (no custom PCB). The **headphone amp** uses an off-the-shelf TPA6132 or MAX97220 breakout module mounted on the HP Board.

## Mechanical Mounting

- **Main Board:** Screwed to top panel via standoffs (M3 or M2.5). Board hangs below top panel, components protrude through panel cutouts.
- **IO Board:** Screwed to top panel via standoffs (M3 or M2.5), left side. Panel-mount components (USB-A, RJ45, MIDI jacks) protrude through top panel cutouts. Connected to main board via 12-pin FFC + 6-pin Ethernet ribbon cable.
- **HP Board:** Panel-mount via headphone jack nut (top panel, left zone). Receives audio + power from Board 1-top via 4-pin JST-PH cable. Optional standoff.
- **I/O Boards (Mother, Daughter, Output):** Mechanically held by panel-mount jack nuts — the 1/4" TS jacks thread through back panel holes and their nuts clamp the boards to the panel. No additional standoffs needed.
- **Power Module:** Off-the-shelf STUSB4500 breakout, secured to back panel by USB-C jack nut or adhesive standoff.
- **Keys4x4 PCB:** Mounted to top panel via standoffs or snap-fit clips. CHOC switches protrude through top panel cutouts, keycaps sit flush with panel surface.
